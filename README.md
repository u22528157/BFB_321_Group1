## Project Overview

A web application that helps ERS220 students find and compare electronic components across multiple suppliers.

**Key Features:**
- Components organized by practical (1, 2, 3) with recommended add-ons.  
- Multi-supplier search for comparing prices across online and physical stores.  
- Filtering by store type (online/physical) and price range.  
- Alternative suggestions for compatible parts when items are out of stock.  
- Reservation system to track selected components across suppliers.  
- Export functionality to generate PDF summaries.

## Wireframes
In order to improve the application's final appearance and functionality, we made a few changes to our initial wireframe from our proposal. The following changes were made: adjusting the colour pallet, creating a more cohesive interface and adjusting the layout to improve user flow and readability. These changes guarantee a more polished and user friendly experience than the original concept, although the general design and intent of each page remains the same.
